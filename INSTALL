A | FAQ/ALL; Issues Common to All Operating Systems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why don't you do "./configure", "make", and "make install" like all the
   normal people I know?
A. I will someday when I get brave enough to make a ./configure script. For
   the most part, it isn't necessary, since all BZLibC++ needs is a working
   C++ compiler and the ar utility, and ar comes with, as far as I know, all
   UNIX-based systems.

Q. When I try to compile maps, BZLibC++ crashes and burns awful. I can't even
   scroll far enough to the top to see the first bunch of error messages.
A1.You forgot to do "chmod -R 755 /usr/include", didn't you? If you didn't
   forget, you should probably email me and give a more thorough description.
A2.You forgot to include the library call. Remember that you MUST include
   the -lbzl switch at the end of the compiler call, e.g. g++ mymap.cpp -lbzl
A3.This has two other causes, one under FAQ/UNIX and one under FAQ/DJGPP.

Q. Why do I keep getting "last.txt: no file or directory" or some mutant
   of that error?
A. last.txt stores your last header file install location for the makefile.
   If you delete or lose last.txt, you can make a new one by placing the path, and
   the path ONLY, of the last place you installed it. If this is your first
   install, then run lastgen.sh. If you want to know where the last place you
   installed it is, but you didn't keep track before, open up src/bzlib.h and
   check the DIRECTORY constant's value. Exclude quotation marks when you put
   the path in last.txt.

Q. I keep getting weird errors involving bzlib.h. I open the file and it's
   completely empty. How do I fix that?
A. Run rescuebzlib.sh, which copies a BZLib.h spare over the old one. This
   scenerio usually happens after errors with the last.txt file, so make
   sure that file exists and shows a valid location. By default, lastgen.sh
   will run rescuebzlib.sh.

Q. I don't want lastgen.sh messing around with BZLibC++, I just want it to
   make a last.txt!
A. Run lastgen.sh with the argument "norescue" like this:
	./lastgen.sh norescue

Q. I'm sick of BZLib whining to me about how my map has too many flags, too
   much rain, or anything like that. How do I make it stop?
A. Recompile BZLibC++ with "#define DO_NOT_WATCH_FOR_BZFLAG_BUGS" in bzlib.h.
   More thorough instructions exist under docs/install/usingdefs.h.

B | FAQ/UNIX; Issues Specific to the UNIX-Based Install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. When I try to compile maps, BZLibC++ crashes and burns awful. I can't even
   scroll far enough to the top to see the first bunch of error messages.
A. Run "make install" again, and this time be on the lookout for error
   messages. It may be the case that "last.txt" isn't found, in which case
   you must use lastgen.sh to regenerate the last.txt file. In all probability,
   you will have lost bzlib.h because of this, and so be sure not to run
   lastgen.sh with the norescue argument.

C | FAQ/DJGPP; Issues Specific to the DJGPP Install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. When I try to compile maps, BZLibC++ crashes and burns awful. I can't even
   scroll far enough to the top to see the first bunch of error messages.
A. Does djgppinstall.bat fail at all? Make sure your path to DJGPP in the
   said file is correct. Remember, to the ROOT directory of DJGPP, such 
   as "C:\\DJGPP". You MUST double the slashes.
