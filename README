BZLibC++ – Procedural Map-Builder for BZFlag

BZLibC++ is a lightweight C++98 toolkit (GPL-2.0-or-later) that lets you script
-generate BZW maps for the open-source tank game BZFlag. 
It provides object-oriented classes for every core primitive—boxes, cones,
pyramids, teleporters, zones, groups, and more—plus a simple “world” 
container that writes a valid .bzw file to disk.

Key points
    Zero external dependencies – builds with any standard C++ compiler.
    Headless automation – ideal for batch or server-side “random map” generation.
    Example programs included – see examples/ for quick demos like googlecube.cpp.
    Fully open-source – GPL-2.0-or-later; hack, modernize, or wrap in Python 
                        bindings as you wish.

Quick build / run

./configure CXXFLAGS="-std=c++03 -Wall"
make          # builds the library + examples
./examples/googlecube        # writes googlecube.bzw
bzflag -world googlecube.bzw # test it in-game

Project status

The code was originally written in 2005-2006 and still works with current
BZFlag servers. Modern contributions—CMake, C++20, RAII, tests, or Python 
bindings—are welcome!
