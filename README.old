UPDATE 2026 â€” This is a library that I wrote nearly 20 years ago. I'm now
uploading it to the internet in case anybody else finds it useful, and
because I have very fond memories of it! Perhaps at some point I'll update it
to a more modern implementation, or add Python bindings. If anybody wants to
take on this project, that'd be great!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BZLibC++ is a development library for BZFlag maps based in C++.

BZLib is intended to create smaller, more effective maps than other libraries 
and accomplishes this desire well. Even maps with 3000 or more objects stay 
under 300 kilobytes, which is compressed wonderfully by BZFlag. Other 
libraries produce maps that, with that many objects, would be on the order of 
5 megabytes.

BZLib also is intended to simplify the process of map making. BZLib will, 
except when turned off, give you advice about what you should and shouldn't do, 
and what might cause issues on some clients.

And lastly, it must do all this FAST. BZLibC++ is used in several scripts for
server reboots where speed is extremely necessary. On a 1GHz AMD machine,
1500 object maps will be generated in 2/5 of a second. What if your server
machine isn't very fast? My 266MHz server managed the 1500 map in a mere 3
seconds. BZLibC++ requires very little memory and uses only the most tested
and efficient algorithms.
