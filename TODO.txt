o Fix the stupid text prefab functions. Lousy interface and a bit buggy about orientation.
o As always, add support for more BZW features. If you are really brave and have a ton
  of time, try to get some mesh interface working. Here's an approximate list of major
  stuff that needs to be added:
      - Mesh
      - Tetrahedron
      - World Weapons
o Wiser dynamicColor and dynamicTexture interfaces. Please keep backward compatibility.
  Right now you kind of require knowledge to use the interfaces. It should be easier
  to use stuff like clampDown and clampUp without having the faintest what it looks
  like in the map file.
o Make an actual Face CLASS. Right now its just a typedef of MeshObject, which works
  fine, but isn't very flexible for the future.
o Fix what bugs I haven't fixed :)
